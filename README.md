 Gates Galore for Logic World.

TO DOWNLOAD:

Go to Code > Download as Zip.

After the folder has downloaded, go to your Downloads folder and unzip it (right click on the folder > Extract All).

Navigate to the Logic World mods folder (Logic World/GameData). Open the extracted folder in Downloads. There should be another folder within it with the same name. Put that in the GameData folder.

Once you have done that, if Logic World is running, close the game. Then start it up and you are good to go!
